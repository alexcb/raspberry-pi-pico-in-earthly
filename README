Compiling raspberry pi pico binaries with Earthly

This example shows how to create a program that will blink an led on
a raspberry pi pico.

To compile:

 1. Install earthly
 2. run: earthly +blink
 3. press-and-hold the bootsel, then plug the raspberry pi pico into the USB port
 4. copy output/blink.uf2 on to the pico's mounted usb drive. Under ubuntu, the following might work:
    cp output/blink.uf2 /media/$USER/RPI-RP2/.
 5. sycn and unmount pico's usb drive (which might happen automatically).
